## üìÇ Overview of CSV Files

The **HCBB-API** system generates **three** main CSV files to track and log real-time game data. These files are regularly updated and stored locally for external usage, such as for overlays, broadcasts, or advanced analysis. The CSV files created are:

1. **`HCBB-API-Stats.csv`**  
   - Tracks live player stats (batters & pitchers).
2. **`HCBB-API-Bases.csv`**  
   - Tracks base runner statuses (1st, 2nd, and 3rd base).
3. **`HCBB-API-Counts.csv`**  
   - Tracks ball and strike counts during the game.

---

## üìÇ File Descriptions

Each of these CSV files has its specific purpose and data they track. Here‚Äôs what each one does:

### 1. **`HCBB-API-Stats.csv`**

- **Purpose**: This file tracks and records **live player statistics**. It includes both **batting** and **pitching** stats, such as a player's power, contact, speed, and stamina. For pitchers, it also tracks the number of pitches thrown during the game.
- **Usage**: This file is essential for monitoring individual player performance and can be used for game analysis, statistical overlays, or player performance tracking in live broadcasts.

---

### 2. **`HCBB-API-Bases.csv`**

- **Purpose**: This file records the status of the bases during the game. It tracks whether a base is occupied or empty and how long it has been occupied. It also includes the file path for visual representation images (e.g., images showing whether a base is occupied or not).
- **Usage**: This file is useful for tracking base runner statuses in real-time. The data can be used for game overlays, to display base occupancy during broadcasts, or for game analysis.

---

### 3. **`HCBB-API-Counts.csv`**

- **Purpose**: This file tracks the **ball and strike counts** for the current batter, along with cumulative totals for balls and strikes throughout the game. It keeps track of the current count (balls-strikes) and the total number of balls and strikes thrown by the pitcher.
- **Usage**: This file is valuable for analyzing the game's progression, keeping track of pitch counts, and providing up-to-date ball/strike information for use in broadcasts or overlays.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use the HCBB-API**

### Step 1: Set Your Variables

Before loading the API, you‚Äôll need to configure some global variables. This is done by setting these variables before calling the main script:

```lua
_G.User = "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
_G.BaseOn = "PATH/TO/YOUR/BASE/ON/IMAGE"
_G.BaseEmpty = "PATH/TO/YOUR/EMPTY/BASE/IMAGE"
```

‚ö° **IMPORTANT**:  
Roblox will strip out forwardslash (`/`) when exporting assets.

If your image paths already contain a forwardslash (`/`), **double it** wherever you see it to avoid errors.  
For example:

**Correct way**: `Images//BaseOn.png`  
**Wrong way**: `Images/BaseOn.png`

Always add an extra `/` when setting your `BaseOn` and `BaseEmpty` paths!

### Step 2: Load the API

After setting your variables, load the script using the following **loadstring**:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grubbalisious/HCBB-API/refs/heads/main/MAIN"))()
```

This will automatically set up the trackers and begin saving your data locally.

At the end it should look like: 

```lua
_G.User = "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
_G.BaseOn = "PATH/TO/YOUR/BASE/ON/IMAGE"
_G.BaseEmpty = "PATH/TO/YOUR/EMPTY/BASE/IMAGE"

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grubbalisious/HCBB-API/refs/heads/main/MAIN"))()
```

## üìù **What Will Be Created**

When you use the **HCBB-API**, it will generate and update several `.txt` files in your local folder:

| File Name              | Description                                                      |

## üìù **Documentation for Hiding Player GUI Elements**

### üìÇ **Purpose**
This script is used to target a player and hide all GUI elements within their `PlayerGui`. It is designed to work with the **HCBB-API**, dynamically using the global `_G.User` variable for the player's username.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How the Script Works**
- **Targeting the Player:** The script targets the player based on the username provided in the global `_G.User` variable.
- **Looping through GUI Elements:** It loops through all GUI elements in the player's `PlayerGui`, specifically searching for `ScreenGui` elements.
- **Hiding GUI Elements:** For every child GUI element within a `ScreenGui`, the script sets their `Visible` property to `false`, effectively hiding them from the player.

### üèóÔ∏è **How to Use the Script**

1. **Set the Player‚Äôs Username**  
   Before running the script, make sure to set the `_G.User` variable to the username of the player you want to target. You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:
   
   ```lua
   _G.User = "your_player_username_here"
   ```

   ‚ö° **IMPORTANT**: Replace `"your_player_username_here"` with the actual username of the player you want to target.

2. **Integrating the Script**  
   Once the username is set, use the script below to hide the GUI elements of the specified player. This will automatically reference the player based on the `_G.User` value.

   ```lua
   -- Use the global _G.User variable to get the player's username from the HCBB-API settings
   local player = game:GetService("Players")[_G.User]

   -- Check if the player exists
   if player then
       -- Loop through all GUI elements in the player's PlayerGui
       for i, v in pairs(player.PlayerGui:GetChildren()) do
           -- Check if the element is a ScreenGui
           if v:IsA("ScreenGui") then
               -- Loop through all children of the ScreenGui and hide them
               for _, guiElement in pairs(v:GetChildren()) do
                   if guiElement:IsA("GuiObject") then
                       guiElement.Visible = false  -- Hide the GUI element
                   end
               end
           end
       end
   else
       print("Player '" .. _G.User .. "' not found")
   end
   ```

### üö® **Important Notes**
- **Setting the Username**: Be sure to set the `_G.User` variable to the correct player's username. This ensures the script targets the correct player and hides their GUI elements.
  
- **Compatibility with HCBB-API**: This script is designed to work seamlessly with the **HCBB-API**. It uses the `_G.User` global variable to retrieve the player's username, making it easy to integrate into your existing HCBB-API setup.

Sure! Here's the updated documentation with that clarification:

## üìÑ **Documentation for Dynamic Camera Control Script (with HCBB-API Integration)**

### üìù **Purpose**
This script allows you to control the camera angles and toggle a custom camera mode for a specific player. The player's username is dynamically retrieved using the **HCBB-API** by referencing the global `_G.User` variable, so you do not need to set the player‚Äôs username manually.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How the Script Works**

1. **Targeting the Player:**
   The script dynamically finds the player using the global `_G.User` variable. If you're using the **HCBB-API**, the player's username will already be set via the API, so there‚Äôs no need for you to manually set it.

2. **Setting Camera Views:**
   The script provides different camera views based on key presses:
   - Press `1` to focus on the home plate view.
   - Press `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6` to switch between different aerial, side, or custom views.
   - Press `z` to toggle a custom scriptable camera mode.

3. **Custom Camera Mode:**
   When toggled on, the camera becomes scriptable, and its position updates according to the selected viewpoint. The camera will continue to focus on the `HomePlate` or any other target you choose.

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   The camera position is updated in real-time using `RenderStepped`, ensuring smooth transitions as the player switches camera views.

### üèóÔ∏è **How to Use**

1. **Running the Script:**
   Since the **HCBB-API** already handles setting the `_G.User` variable, you do not need to manually specify the player's username.

   To run the script, you can simply load it using **loadstring** to execute it dynamically:

   ```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grubbalisious/HCBB-API/refs/heads/main/CAMERA"))()
   ```

   This will load and execute the script that allows you to control the camera in real-time for the specified player.

### üö® **Important Notes**
- **Player Must Be Online:** The script only works if the player with the username set in `_G.User` is currently in the game.
- **Camera Updates in Real-Time:** The script continuously updates the camera's position using `RenderStepped`, ensuring that the camera follows the selected viewpoint dynamically.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Known Issues**

While the HCBB-API is fully operational, there are a few bugs being addressed:

- **Pitcher and batter stats** might not always pull correctly after substitutions or player swaps.
- In some cases, **relief pitchers** or **pinch hitters** can cause stat overlaps.
- GUI elements might fail to load instantly at game start, especially if the player loads in late. The system will attempt to **re-check and recover** when this happens.

üõ†Ô∏è **Fixes for these issues are in development.**  
The goal is to automatically detect swaps better and prevent wrong stats from displaying in future versions.

## üì¢ **Why This Project Exists**

HCBB 9v9 is one of the most competitive and detailed baseball games on Roblox, but it has historically lacked advanced tools for **stat tracking**, **broadcasting**, or **live overlays**.

The **HCBB-API** was created to help change that ‚Äî to build a bigger, more connected community around HCBB gameplay. We believe HCBB deserves **more awareness** and recognition!

As more tools like this become available, players will have even more reasons to dive deeper into **leagues**, **tournaments**, and the **competitive side** of the game.

This project is just getting started, and **more updates, features, and improvements** are coming soon!

Stay tuned for better pitcher/batter support, automatic player detection, improved base handling, and full game archiving features.

Thanks for the correction! Here‚Äôs the updated version with the proper terminology:
